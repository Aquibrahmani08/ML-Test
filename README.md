Before Importing the Data into Jupyter Notebook

Before importing the data into Jupyter Notebook, it's important to perform the following steps to prepare the data:

Step 1: Convert Text to Columns

Use the "Text to Columns" option in the "Data" ribbon to convert the raw data from text format into separate columns. This helps in organizing the data and making it easier to analyze.
Step 2: Create a Table to Identify String Values

Create a table to identify any string values, particularly in the 'price_new' column. This step helps in detecting any inconsistencies or anomalies in the data that may need to be addressed before further analysis.
Step 3: Replace String Values with Null

Detect and replace any string values found in the 'price_new' column with null values. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the data and avoids potential errors during analysis.
Once these steps are completed, the data is ready to be imported into Jupyter Notebook for further processing and analysis.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the data is properly prepared and cleaned before importing it into Jupyter Notebook, which facilitates smoother and more accurate analysis.

**After Prediction Analysis**

After performing the prediction analysis using multiple regression and KNN regression, the following results were obtained:

Accuracy Rate of Multiple Regression: 60%
Accuracy Rate of KNN Regression: 80%
It was observed that the accuracy of KNN regression is higher than that of multiple linear regression by 20%. Therefore, the KNN regression model is selected for future use due to its superior predictive performance.

Saving the KNN Regression Model

The trained KNN regression model is saved for future use. This ensures that the model can be easily accessed and reused for making predictions on new data.
Providing Raw Data for Prediction

Additionally, raw data is provided to the KNN regression model for prediction. This raw data consists of input variables for which the model will predict the corresponding output values.
By following this process, the KNN regression model with its higher accuracy is selected for future use, and raw data is provided to make predictions, ensuring efficient and effective utilization of the predictive model.
